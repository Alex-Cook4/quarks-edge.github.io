  Quarks is for data science professionals (data developers, data engineers, data scientists) to build analytics at the edge to power IoT applications.

**Data Engineers** add edge analytics to their overall data architecture, creating a streaming analytics hierarchy from the edge to the gateway to centralized analytic systems.

**Data Developers** build streaming analytics on the edge, whether it's new analytics or pushing centralized analytics out to the edge.

**Data Scientists** get relevant information directly from IoT devices and extend the data for analysis in a more timely and useful manner.
