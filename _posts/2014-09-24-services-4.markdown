Quarks is a micro-kernel style runtime for execution enabling analytics on small-footprint edge devices or sensors, such as Raspberry Pis or smart phones. It supports windowing against a continuous stream of data for aggregation. Quarks also delivers the following features:

**Java APIs** for developing applications that execute analytics using a per-event (data item) streaming paradigm

**Connectors** for MQTT, HTTP, JDBC, File, Apache Kafka and IBM Watson IoT Platform

**Multi-Platform support** including Java 8, Java 7 and Android. Producing a stream that contains a phoneâ€™s sensor events is an example of Android-specific functionality

**Development mode** including a web-console for viewing the graph of running applications

**Testing mechanism** for Quarks' applications which integrates with assertion based testing systems such as JUnit
