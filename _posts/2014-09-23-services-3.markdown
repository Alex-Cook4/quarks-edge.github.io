   Quarks enables continuous streaming analytics on gateways and edge devices which can work with centralized systems to provide efficient and timely analytics across the whole IoT ecosystem: from the center to the edge.    
    
   **Reduced Communication Costs**&nbsp;&nbsp;Quarks locally separates the interesting from the mundane, so you donâ€™t have to send every sensor reading over a network. If 99% of readings are normal, Quarks detects the 1% anomalies and just transmits those for further processing. 
   
   **Local Action**&nbsp;&nbsp;Quarks makes devices more intelligent enabling them to take immediate action.  For example, a connected vehicle running Quarks can adjust traction control based on the weight of the cargo/passengers.   
   
   **Learning from Related Devices**&nbsp;&nbsp;Connected devices can become more intelligent by understanding related devices. For example, a truck maneuvering roads in Oregon can adjust based on the data received from trucks operating under similar loads and conditions in Colorado; data such as altitude, cargo, weather and traffic conditions.
